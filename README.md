# MemoryGame
This memory game utilizes the PokeAPI in order to fetch a few Pokemon along with their details such as their images and ID numbers. The point of the game is to not click the same card twice before clicking every card once! The purpose of building this project was to enhance my familiarity with React, transitioning from my prior experience with plain JavaScript.
